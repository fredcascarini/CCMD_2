# CCMD mark 2

<i>Adapted version of CCMD</i>

This is an updated version of the CCMD code, which removes the beta parameter, replacing it with the einstein A parameter, and considering laser parameters. A sample trap.info input file is included in the config 
directories.

To compile:
run 'make' in /src directory

To run:
run 'ccmd.exe [path to trap.info file]' in /bin directory. Output is saved to the same directory as the trap.info file.
